## 0.Basic of Spring

- Spring Initializ created a Maven project for us http://start.spring.io

- We can choose dependicies for our project 

- "*application.properties*" files allows to make choose about our server properties 
```
- @Value("${coach.name}")
- private String coachName
```

**Let's break down the code:**

- `@Value("${coach.name}")`: This annotation indicates that the value of the `coachName` field should be injected from the `coach.name` application property.
- `private String coachName`: This line declares a field named `coachName`. The field's access modifier is set to `private`, which means it can only be accessed within this class.
- `String`: This specifies the data type of the `coachName` field. In this case, the field will be a string.

**Here's an example of how this code works:**

Let's say your application property file (`application.properties`) is defined as follows:

```
coach.name=John Doe
```

In this case, the `coachName` field will be assigned the value "John Doe". Whenever your code accesses this field, it will retrieve the string "John Doe".

**Here are some benefits of using this code:**

- **Reduces code duplication:** If you need to use your application property in multiple places, you can define it in a single place and use it with the `@Value` annotation instead of repeating it everywhere.
- **Makes your code more readable:** Explicitly stating the names of application properties in your code makes it easier to understand what your code is doing.
- **Facilitates changes:** If you need to make a change to your application property, you only need to make it in one place. All references in your code will be automatically updated.









## 1.Spring Boot Starter

In Spring Boot, a **starter** is a pre-configured set of dependencies that simplify and expedite the development process. They act like building blocks, providing essential libraries and functionalities without requiring you to manually search for and add individual dependencies.

Here's a breakdown of what Spring Boot starters offer:

- **Reduced Boilerplate Code:** Starter dependencies bundle together commonly used libraries, eliminating the need to manually configure and add them to your project. This saves time and reduces boilerplate code in your application.
- **Simplified Dependency Management:** Starters manage dependencies and their versions, ensuring compatibility and avoiding conflicts. They handle potential conflicts between different library versions, so you don't have to worry about them.
- **Faster Development:** By pre-configuring dependencies, starters allow you to focus on writing your application logic instead of spending time on setting up the environment. This can significantly accelerate your development process.

## **2.Rest Controller**


```
@RestController
public class FunRestController {

// expose "/" that returns "Hello World"

@GetMapping("/")
public String sayHello(){
 return "Hello World!";
}
}
```


This code defines a controller class for a RESTful API in a Spring Boot application. It works as follows:

- **`@RestController` annotation:** This annotation specifies that the class is a Rest Controller. This means that the class can handle HTTP requests and return data in formats like JSON or XML.
- **`public class FunRestController`:** This line defines a class named `FunRestController`. This class contains the functionality of the controller class.
- **`@GetMapping("/")`:** This annotation specifies that the `sayHello` method will respond to an HTTP GET request. It also specifies the request path as "/". This means that the `sayHello` method will be called when the user sends a GET request to the root URL (`http://localhost:8080/`).
- **`public String sayHello(){`:** This line defines a method named `sayHello` with a return type of `String`. This method is called when the HTTP request is processed.
- **`return "Hello World!";`:** This line returns the text "Hello World!". This text is sent as a response to the HTTP request.

In summary, this code creates a simple RESTful API that returns the message "Hello World!" when a user sends a GET request to the root URL.





## 3.Actuator

Spring Boot Actuator: Monitoring and Management Made Easier

**Spring Boot Actuator** is a set of built-in features within Spring Boot that provide **monitoring and management** capabilities for your applications. It allows you to easily:

- **Monitor** the health and performance of your application, including information about CPU usage, memory consumption, and thread health.
- **Manage** your application by exposing endpoints you can use to perform various actions, such as:
    - Checking application health
    - Viewing environment information
    - Getting thread dumps
    - Shutting down the application

**Benefits of Using Spring Boot Actuator:**

- **Reduced Boilerplate Code:** Actuator provides pre-built features, saving you time and effort compared to implementing custom solutions from scratch.
- **Improved Monitoring and Management:** It simplifies monitoring application health and performance and allows you to perform management tasks easily.
- **Simplified Integration:** Actuator integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot applications, requiring minimal configuration.

**How Actuator Works:**

1. **Endpoint Discovery:** Spring Boot Actuator exposes various HTTP endpoints that can be accessed to access information and perform actions. These endpoints are typically available under the `/actuator` path.
2. **Security:** Actuator endpoints are secured by default, requiring proper authentication and authorization to access them. You can configure security settings to control access to specific endpoints.
3. **Customization:** While Actuator provides pre-built functionality, you can also customize it to expose additional information or perform specific actions through custom endpoints.

**Commonly Used Actuator Endpoints:**

- **`/health`:** Provides information about the overall health of your application.
- **`/info`:** Exposes general information about your application, such as environment details and build information.
- **`/beans`:** Lists all Spring beans managed by the application context.
- **`/metrics`:** Provides various metrics about the application, such as memory usage and thread pool information.

**Overall, Spring Boot Actuator is a valuable tool for developers and operations teams by simplifying application monitoring, management, and troubleshooting.**
